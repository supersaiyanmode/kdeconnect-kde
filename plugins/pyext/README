This plugin embeds a Python interpreter, and allows for writing python scripts that extend the functionality.
These scripts can respond to android system events (such as phone unlock) or be manually invoked via the Android App.

Currently, it supports just two events: 1) Manual invocation 2) Phone Unlock.

Sample scripts here: https://github.com/supersaiyanmode/KDEConnect-PyExtScripts
